<p>I’ve lived in the D.C. area all my life but I’m new to the city. I just moved from Virginia to the city last year.</p>

<p>I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Fine Arts and initially wanted to be a graphic designer. Unfortunately I didn’t have much luck finding a job in that field. I currently work at a dog daycare place. As much as I love working with the dogs there isn’t really any opportunities for me to move up. I’ve always been good with computers so I decided to explore coding. I signed up for the GW boot camp last December to help me gain the necessary skills to find a better job.</p>

<p>My hobbies include drawing, photography, comics and watching films. I live with my dog, a little Bichon Frise named Nicky.</p>
